    <h1>JavaScript Features Overview {Basics}</h1>

    <!-- Interpreted -->
    <details>
        <summary>1. Interpreted Language</summary>
        <p>
            JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning it's executed line-by-line at runtime by the JavaScript
            engine in the browser or server environment, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computers only understand machine code, represented as 0s and 1s. A program running in the RAM is converted
            into this format by interpreters or compilers. Interpreters like the one used in JavaScript process code
            line by line.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Upsides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No need for a separate compilation step before execution, making development faster.</li>
            <li>It allows immediate feedback, making it ideal for web development and prototyping.</li>
            <li>Code is portable and can be run in any environment with a JavaScript engine (browsers, Node.js).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Downsides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Execution can be slower compared to compiled languages like C++ or Java due to interpretation overhead.
            </li>
            <li>More prone to runtime errors, which can impact performance and stability.</li>
            <li>Security vulnerabilities may arise since source code is directly accessible.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <!-- Dynamically Typed -->
    <details>
        <summary>2. Dynamically Typed</summary>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, variables are not tied to any specific data type. Types are determined at runtime and can
            change as the program executes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>
var a = 1;
a = "Abhi"; 
a = true;

console.log(a);  // Output: true
  </code></pre>
        <p><strong>Upsides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flexibility: Variables can hold any type of data without restrictions.</li>
            <li>Fewer lines of code since there's no need to declare types explicitly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Downsides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased chance of bugs due to unexpected type changes.</li>
            <li>Debugging can be more difficult as the type of variables can change dynamically.</li>
            <li>Performance may be slower due to type checks at runtime.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <!-- Single-threaded -->
    <details>
        <summary>3. Single-threaded</summary>
        <p>
            JavaScript operates in a single-threaded environment, which means it processes one task at a time. Even
            though JavaScript is single-threaded, it can handle asynchronous tasks through mechanisms like event loops
            and callbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Applications reside on the SSD and are loaded into RAM for execution. In the RAM, everything is represented
            as 0s and 1s. The JavaScript interpreter processes code line by line, allowing it to partially execute code
            up to the point where errors occur.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Upsides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple concurrency model: No need to worry about issues like deadlocks or race conditions typically
                found in multi-threaded programming.</li>
            <li>Event-driven programming makes handling user interactions and asynchronous tasks easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Downsides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited ability to utilize multi-core processors efficiently.</li>
            <li>Long-running tasks can block the execution thread, causing performance issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <!-- Garbage Collected -->
    <details>
        <summary>4. Garbage Collected</summary>
        <p>
            JavaScript automatically manages memory through garbage collection, which periodically frees memory used by
            objects that are no longer in use.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Upsides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prevents memory leaks by automatically reclaiming memory.</li>
            <li>Developers don’t need to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Downsides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Garbage collection can introduce slight performance overhead.</li>
            <li>It’s not always immediate, so memory may not be freed as soon as it's no longer needed.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <!-- ECMAScript -->
    <details>
        <summary>5. ECMAScript (ES)</summary>
        <p>
            ECMAScript is the standardized scripting language that JavaScript is based on. The evolution of JavaScript
            is tracked through versions of ECMAScript, such as ES5, ES6 (also known as ES2015), and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compilers convert high-level languages (like JavaScript) into machine code (0s and 1s). Unlike compilers
            that process the entire code at once, JavaScript interpreters process it line by line.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features of ES6 and later:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrow functions: Concise syntax for writing functions.</li>
            <li>Let and const: Block-scoped variables and constants.</li>
            <li>Classes: A cleaner syntax for defining objects and inheritance.</li>
            <li>Promises: Built-in support for asynchronous programming.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ECMAScript continues to evolve, bringing new features and improvements with each release, ensuring JavaScript
            remains powerful and modern.</p>
